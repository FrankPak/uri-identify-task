I did this task in about 3 hours, possibly little bit over. This task was good practice to really put together skills I've gathered from studying at the University. The task made me think some while since I had to reread it, understand the text and it had been some time since I used python. How i understood it was that another app sends a uri to class identify and will return the path and parameters if called. I used the knowledge from DSA course in the university. 

First problems were aware of i had to parse strings that didn't have all in specific type so i had to parse the string list many times to get the actual information out. And the biggest problem I had was making sure that everything was checked and would raise errors if something was wrong, like if there were extra parameters at the end of uri or miss inputs from systems. I made sure that the program would inform also what went wrong and where it would be located, and what it expected, and trying to keep the system scaleable.

If I would, future improvements would be to say the code seems little big, and there could be possibly room for optimizations like, if I had used outside libraries to parse the code quicker and made it more simpler in style.

Thank you for letting me participate in this task, I think in the end it was fun challenge and hopefully I'll get to go forward to the interviews.
