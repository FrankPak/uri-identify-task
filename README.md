I did this task in about 3 hours, possibly little bit over. This task was good practice to really put together skills I've gathered from studying at the University, I used the knowledge from python course, DSA course and also from Java course, that helped me build this program.
The task made me reread the given requirements to understand the text and it had been some time since I used python. How I understood it was that another app sends a uri to class identify and will return the path and parameters if called, it needed to parse the given uri, check that it had visma-identity, after check that it included with one of the 3 paths, and these paths would be have specific parameters that needed to be saved. After everything it would need to be checked that everything in the uri was correct.

First problems I had was to parse strings that didn't have the same special letter, so I had to parse the string many times to get the actual information out.
The biggest problem I had was making sure that everything was checked and would raise errors if something was wrong, like if there were extra parameters at the end of uri or miss inputs from different systems.
 I made sure that the program would inform also what went wrong and where it would be located, and what it expected, and trying to keep the system saleable.

If I would, future improvements would be to say the code seems little big, and there could be possibly room for optimizations like, if I had used outside libraries to parse the code quicker and made it simpler in style.

Thank you for letting me participate in this task, I think in the end it was fun challenge and hopefully I'll get to go forward to the interviews.
