I did this task in about 3 hours, possibly little bit over. This task was good practice to really put together skills I've gathered from studying at the University. The task made me think some while since I had to reread it, understand the text and it had been some time since I used python.

After I finished the initial structure, I started to really think what mistakes the other apps, requesting services or a human mistake could make, so I made sure to include failure checks for wrong parameters and everything. I made sure that the program would inform also what went wrong and where it would be located, and what it expected.

If I would, future improvements would be to say the code seems little big, and there could be possibly room for optimizations like, if I had used outside libraries to parse the code quicker. 

Thank you for letting me participate in this task, I think in the end it was fun challenge and hopefully I'll get to go forward to the interviews.
